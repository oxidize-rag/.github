# 🐙 Oxidize-RAG Organization

> **High-Performance AI Infrastructure, Built in Rust.**

Welcome to the official home of the **Oxidize-RAG** framework and its ecosystem. We are dedicated to building zero-cost, memory-safe, and hardware-accelerated tools for the next generation of AI applications.

## 💎 Our Mission

In a world dominated by slow, memory-intensive AI middleware, we choose to **Oxidize**. 

We believe that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) should be:
- **Fast**: Sub-millisecond search at any scale.
- **Safe**: Leveraging Rust's ownership model to eliminate concurrency bugs.
- **Transparent**: Low-level control with high-level developer experience.

## 🔭 Featured Projects

### [Oxidize-RAG (Core Framework)](https://github.com/oxidize-rag/oxidize)
The flagship mono-repo containing the modular RAG framework, SIMD search kernels, and local storage engines.

### [Upcoming] Tensor-Oxide
A low-level tensor library optimized specifically for RAG workloads.

### [Upcoming] Oxidize-Gateway
A high-throughput gRPC gateway for exposing RAG agents at scale.
